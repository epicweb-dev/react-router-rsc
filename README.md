  <strong>
    React Router's take on React Server Components
  </strong>
  <p>
    React Server Components have changed how we think about building React applications. In this lightning talk, Kent will explore how React Router is embracing RSC and what this means for the future of routing in React applications. This talk will dive into how RSC has simplified React Router's architecture and enables powerful new patterns for data loading, streaming, and code splitting.

    We'll see how React Router has evolved to work seamlessly with React Server Components, making it easier than ever to build full-stack React applications with excellent performance and developer experience.

## Prerequisites

- Understand the basics of React Server Components

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [React Server Components docs](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components)
- [Epic React Workshop on React Server Components](https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-server-components)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-router-rsc.git
cd react-router-rsc
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

## The Workshop App

Learn all about the workshop app on the
[Epic Web Getting Started Guide](https://www.epicweb.dev/get-started).
